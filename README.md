Solano BlockChain Project

## Description
AutoChain is a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling vehicles transparently using blockchain technology.

The traditional car sales industry lacks transparency, with hidden histories and price manipulation.
Buyers and sellers often deal with intermediaries, increasing costs and reducing trust.

NFT-based car ownership: Each car is minted as an NFT, ensuring verifiable ownership.
Dynamic pricing: Real-world data from oracles updates car values.
On-chain sales history: Public and tamper-proof transaction records enhance transparency.
